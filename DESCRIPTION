Description: The total deviation index (TDI) is an unscaled statistical measure used to evaluate the deviation between paired quantitative measurements when assessing the extent of agreement between different raters. It describes a boundary such that a large specified proportion of the differences in paired measurements are within the boundary (Lin, 2000) <https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(20000130)19:2<255::AID-SIM293>3.0.CO;2-8>.
    This R package implements some methodologies existing in the literature for TDI estimation and inference in the case of two raters.
